# QuartetRobot
A personal research on the quadruped Solo Robot. The name "QuartetRobot" means "quadruped" and involves the concept of swarming robot and robotic cooperation.
The quadruped Solo Robot, led by Professor Ludovic Righetti at NYU Tandon, is a interesting program which is open-sourced and pretty impressive.
A great chance to learn about robot control and locomotion.
