# QuartetRobot
A personal research on the quadruped Solo Robot. The name "QuartetRobot" means "quadruped" and involves the concept of swarming robot and robotic cooperation.
The quadruped Solo Robot, led by Professor Ludovic Righetti at NYU Tandon, is a interesting program which is open-sourced and pretty impressive.
A great chance to learn about robot control and locomotion.

Personal intro:
This is (Danny) Mingxi Jia, an incoming master student at NYU, major in Mechatronics and Robotics Engineering.
Due to the COVID-19, I will defer my study to Fall 2021 and mainly focus on this project this year.
